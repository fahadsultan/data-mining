* Unsupervised Learning
* Supervised Learning
* Ethical considerations in Data Mining

## Course Goals
<!-- 
* Enable students to start careers as data scientists by providing experience working with real-world data, tools, and techniques

* Empower students to apply computational and inferential thinking to address real-world problems -->

On successful completion of the course, the students should have the ability to identify and apply appropriate data mining and/or machine learning techniques towards solving problems of pattern recogition, learning and prediction.
