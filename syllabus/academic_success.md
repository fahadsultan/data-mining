## Center for Academic Success (CAS; LIB 002)

<br/>

_**Peer Tutors**_ are available free of charge for many classes and may be requested by dropping by CAS (LIB 002) or on the **[Center for Academic Success](https://www.furman.edu/academics/center-academic-success/)** website. Tutors are typically recommended by faculty and have performed well in the class.
<br/>

The **[Writing & Media Lab (WML)](https://www.furman.edu/academics/center-academic-success/writing-resources/)** is staffed by student Consultants who are trained to help you improve your writing and multimodal communication skills.  The consultation process is non-directive and intended to allow students to maintain ownership of their work.  In addition to helping with the nuts and bolts, WML Consultants also support you in developing your own ideas thoughtfully and critically, whether youâ€™re writing an essay or planning a video or other multimedia project.  You may drop into the WML during its regular hours (LIB 002; 9 AM to 10 PM) or visit the Writing and Media Lab website to make an appointment online.

<br/>
_Professional Academic Assistance Staff_ in CAS can provide students assistance with time management, study skills, and organizational skills.

<br/>
_The Writing and ESL Specialist_ provides professional writing support as well as support for students whose primary language is not English.
