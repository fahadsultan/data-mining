# Syllabus

## Pre-requisites

* CSC-121 Introduction to Computer Programming

## Fulfills requirements

* Core course requirement for Data Analytics minor
* Human Behavior GER

## Course Description

This course focuses on the algorithms and computing tools fundamental to data science: the process of extracting accurate and generalizable models from data via machine learning. Topics will include the prediction of outcomes, the discovery of associations, and the identification of similar groups. Students will complete a project related to human behavior, starting with data collection and cleaning, culminating in the presentation of a model and visualization of results.

## Course Goals
<!-- 
* Enable students to start careers as data scientists by providing experience working with real-world data, tools, and techniques

* Empower students to apply computational and inferential thinking to address real-world problems -->

On successful completion of the course, the students should have the ability to identify and apply appropriate data mining and/or machine learning techniques towards solving problems of pattern recogition, learning and prediction. The course also aims to instill in students a deep sensitivity of issues of algorithmic bias and fairness in data mining.
