**Proposal Due**: Thursday, October 21, 2021

**Progress Report Due**: Thursday, November 11, 2021

**Final Report Due**: Thursday, December 2, 2021

The project will involve concentrated work in one research project related to Data Mining. 

* The possible choices of projects will be constrained to those listed below, so there will be several groups working independently on each project.  

* You will not be allowed to propose your own project topic, but each topic leaves enough room to pursue distinct directions so that I expect to see variety among the submissions.  

* I will also be encouraging the use of Piazza for questions/discussions about your project, as well as occasional “town halls” about each project in or immediately after class.    

* While I anticipate that much of the work will be done as the deadline approaches, it is important to get started early enough to discover insurmountable roadblocks in data acquisition or problem definition before it is too late.  

    * The project proposal and progress reports have been instituted to ensure people get serious well in advance of the final deadline.

* Each group will be responsible to turn in **3-5 page project proposals/literature search and progress reports** as of the dates above.  

* I will award almost half of the total grade for each project on the strength of the preliminary reports.  This is to encourage starting early, and to make sure that you and I both know what you are to do before it is too late to avoid trouble. 

* My hope is that the best of the submissions for one or more of these topics will lead to published work.  

    * This has been the case several times when I have taught such a course.  

## Rules of the Game

From past experience, I have found that students tend to herd on a small subset of possible projects. Further, they are irresistibly drawn to poor choices: that offer the least available data, that have limited ways to evaluate success, or little freedom for creativity in modeling.   I have colored the topics I think best in red and marked.  Please consider projects which seem less popular -- likely they will prove better to work on.

Take the time to investigate multiple options during the proposal phase.   You should have gotten some preliminary results by then, enough to provide confidence you will be able to successfully complete the project. 

I reserve the right to reassign the groups with the weakest proposals to other topics for the second phase of the project, both to rescue them from a bad situation and rebalance the class.

A substantial part of the grading of the projects will be done by peers: each student will be charged with grading three other projects on the same topic.   Part of your grade for the course will be a function of how seriously you take this, e.g the quality of your feedback.   Peer review is how research papers are selected for publication, and I hope this will be revealing.  I am hoping that this review will provide insights to improve your own projects as well.

To preserve anonymity in submissions, it is important that the papers you submit online for grading not contain your names or ID numbers.    Indeed, the peer grading form/rubric will include a question if the grader can figure out whose paper they have, and if so we will take off points.

Expect to be asked to do a trial peer grading exercise to test our system soon.   Please respond promptly.

Group sizes should usually range from two to three students.   The amount of work per group is expected to scale linearly with the effort involved.    The projects are large enough that I do not think students working by themselves can achieve the critical mass to get a substantial project done, and are strongly discouraged.

Each student will be asked to proportion their group’s effort among all the team members they are working with.   So make sure you work with people who you like, trust, and respect.
I will possibly add another few projects later, so check back occasionally.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

# Peer Grading

# Presentation

## Identify Data set 

* Identify a data set that you will use for your project.

* The data set should be large enough to be interesting, but not so large that it is unwieldy.

* The data set should be publicly available.

* The data set should be interesting to you.

* The data set should be related to the topic of the project you have chosen.

* The data set should be in a format that you can easily work with.

## Modeling



## Evaluation



## Clustering 

Your project must involve clustering.  You may use any clustering algorithm you like, but you must use at least two different algorithms.  You may use any clustering evaluation metric you like, but you must use at least two different metrics.  You must compare the results of the different algorithms and metrics.  You must explain why you chose the algorithms and metrics you did.  You must explain why you chose the number of clusters you did. 

## Baselines

You must compare your clustering results to a baseline.  The baseline may be a random clustering, a clustering based on a simple heuristic, or a clustering based on a simple model.  You must explain why you chose the baseline you did.  You must explain why you chose the number of clusters you did for the baseline.

## Results

You must present your results in a clear and understandable way.  You must explain what the results mean.  You must explain why the results are interesting.  You must explain what you learned from the results.  You must explain what you would do differently if you were to do the project again.
